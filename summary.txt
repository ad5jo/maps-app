Map fun is about providing information to newcommers to an area.
Being new in town you don't know where to stay or eat or even what to wear. The app will provide immediate local weather, traffic, News and more.
We designed this for people that like to travel and have fun. It is mobile by design and looks good on a normal laptop as well.

The design was broken into managable individual tasks to allow concurrent development. The mainpage layout is bootstrap and the elements are rebuilt as needed to display content.

APIs
Google API for maps and traffic
New York Times API for news
Weather Underground API

Libraries/ Framework
Moment
Bootstrap

Attemps were made to use other APIs but didn't get finished
Yelp - working single page.
BreweryDB - working to get local beer information. Doesn't have street addresses.

Adding a few more APIs for fun attractions and food will make this app more useful.

D'Ann Hart - Main Page, CSS, Bootstrap, Traffic tons of details
Alec Jandorek - Maps
Roy Cahn-Speyer - News
Dave Durkee - Weather
